""" This file contains the code for the extractor class for Chaos-R games. 
!! Important: the extraction should be done after the encoding fix.

## text structure description
    The text content of the games of Chaos-R is stored in the form of KAG (Kirikiri Adventure Game) scripts.
    The details of this format can be found here: https://kirikirikag.sourceforge.net/contents/index.html.
    The extension of these files is .ks and normally they are not stored in plain text without encryption. 
    Each .ks file corresponds to a scenario and they are stored in the .xp3 files of the game (usually the k_scenario.xp3 file).
