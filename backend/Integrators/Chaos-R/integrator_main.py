"""
The games of Chaos-R are developed using the KAG (Kirikiri Adventure Game) engine.
For now the games considered are stored without encryption and in Shift-JIS encoding.

Normally the game must be run with Locale Emulator, otherwise the program will crash.
So the first step should be convert all the scripts to UTF-8 encoding. 
This will be done with the encoding_fix.py script.
